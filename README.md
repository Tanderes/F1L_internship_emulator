Given Key Scientific Question (KSQ): 

The KSQ: Using available scRNA-seq data from cancer cell lines, how would you explore the use of the following FDA-approved antibody therapies in additional cancers?
Trastuzumab: Targets HER2 and is used in the treatment of HER2-positive breast and gastric cancers.
Bevacizumab: Targets VEGF and is used for a variety of cancers, including colorectal, lung, glioblastoma, breast, liver, and kidney cancer.

Approach:

1. We should first understand what is scRNA-seq data, how was it produced, and how to access it. 

      scRNA-seq = single cell RNA sequencing
      Provides gene expression on a single-cell level. 
      Potential pitfalls: First, single-cell experiments are generally more expensive and more difficult to properly conduct. Second, the downstream analysis becomes more complex due to the increased resolution, and it is easier to draw false conclusions. [https://www.sc-best-practices.org/introduction/scrna_seq.html]

  The methods for collecting scRNA-seq data can differ, we should keep this in mind when looking at scRNA-seq across cell lines as this might bias the comparisons that we can make. 

  Other questions we should address: 
  
2. What is an antibody therapy and how does it work at treating cancer? 
3. How do Trastuzumab and Bevacizumab work?
4. Are there any off-target genes that are
